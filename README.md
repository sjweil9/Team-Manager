# Team-Manager
A full-stack MEAN application with CRUD operations

The app uses Angular for the front-end, a Node/Express server for the back-end, and MongoDB (with Mongoose) for the database.

This is a demonstration project that showcases full CRUD operations alongside front-end interactivity.

The app provides the ability for a manager of a sports team to manage rosters and lineups for upcoming games.
